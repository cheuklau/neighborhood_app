# Catalog App

Date: 6/18/2018

In this project, we are creating a neighborhood app which shows multiple pre-defined locations using the Google Maps API. The name of the locations are displayed in a list on the left along with a drop-down menu, both of which allow users to select specific locations. When the user selects a specific location, the corresponding map marker along with its info window are displayed. Links to the most recent news articles for the selected location are loaded from the New York Times API, and displayed on the right-hand side. For this project, I chose the top five national laboratories in the United States as the locations of interest. For mobile display, the three columns are rotated and stacked on top of each other using responsive design. 

## Dependencies

The project was tested using Google Chrome web browser. The app uses Knockout JS and Jquery, both of which are located in `/js/lib/`. An internet connection is required to load the Google Maps and New York Times APIs.

## Running the Neighborhood App

To run the neighborhood app, simply open `index.html` into a web browser (note: only tested on Google Chrome).
